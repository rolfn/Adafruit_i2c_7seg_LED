# Adafruit_i2c_7seg_LED
A Arduino library for Adafruit 7-segment displays like
[this](https://www.adafruit.com/products/879) or
[that](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1269). The library is much simpler
than the library provided by
[Adafruit](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-LED-Backpack-Library). It based
on Peter Sjoberg's  [htk1633 library](https://github.com/lpaseen/ht16k33).
